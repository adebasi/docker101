# Docker commands

## Images

Working with Docker, normally everything starts with an image which is required to start a container. This is where [Docker-Hub](hub.docker.com) comes into play. Docker-Hub provides lots of images to download. Some images are official like `nginx` and some are user generated like `adebasi/pingpong`.

Go ahead and download `nginx`:

`$ docker pull nginx`

All downloaded images can be listed by:

`$ docker images`

## Container

Images are immutable and readonly. When starting a container, Docker adds a read/write layer on top of these immutable layers, so processes in the container can write files.

Let's start a container:

`$ docker run -d nginx`

`-d` starts containers in the background (detached).

To see all running containers execute:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
7401b15512dd        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   3 seconds ago       Up 1 second         80/tcp              funny_hopper
```

### Portforward

You can see that the nginx is running and it is listening on Port 80, but `curl localhost:80` won't work. You have to forward the containers port in order to access it locally.

`$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`

Now you can `curl localhost:8080` to see the nginx welcome site.

### Mount

But you don't want to show a default page to the world. Let's configure the nginx to serve our `index.html`.

`$ docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx`

`-v` lets you mount a directory from you local machine into the container. Nginx loads static content by default from `/usr/share/nginx/html`, therefore we use that path as destination for our website.

When you see an error like the following one, you have to stop the container using port 8080 before you can start another one:

`Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated.`

Stop the container like this:

`$ docker stop <containerId>`

Then you can start the container mounting our `index.html` and open a browser on http://localhost:8080.

### Clean up

The running containers can be stopped and removed if wanted:

`$ docker stop <CONTAINER ID>`

`$ docker rm <CONTAINER ID>`
